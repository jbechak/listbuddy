## Background
As a musician who performs at plenty of weddings and other events, I am often tasked with creating a setlist from songs lists that vocalists email out. These lists contain extra details, with each entry usually having the song name, a separator, an artist name, sometimes the name of a key, and sometimes an asterisk either at the beginning or end to denote a requested song. While performing, I like the setlist that I'm looking at to have the largest font size possible and to be as concise as possible. To help create concise setlists, List Buddy removes the artist name from every song, neatly formats the key name at the end, and ensures that any asterisk appears before its song and not after. After running these song lists through List Buddy, creating a uniform-looking setlist is a breeze.
